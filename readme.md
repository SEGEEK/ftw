Angular 1 + Typescript + Webpack + Full Stack

Very much a work in progress

### Setup

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp run
```
This will build the server and the client app, and watch both.  The server will reload when changes are made

### Todo
* Get Typescript actually working
* Get typings setup
* Get angular included
* Get something like browser sync in place
